## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to replicate the design of a website for a competition. The layout and styling are crafted using **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring the site is fully responsive and adheres to modern web design principles. **JavaScript** is used to add interactivity, making the user experience dynamic and engaging.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the website.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid UI development and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and dynamic functionality.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Interactive Elements**: JavaScript is used to handle user interactions, such as button clicks, dynamic content updates, and other interactive behaviors.
- **Consistent Styling**: Images, buttons, and text elements are all styled consistently using Tailwind's utility classes.
- **Equal Image Sizes**: All images are displayed in a fixed size, maintaining uniformity across different cards or sections.
- **Component Structure**: Reusable, modular components for easy scalability and maintainability.

## Installation

To get started with this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/site-clone-project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd site-clone-project
   ```

3. **Install Tailwind CSS** (if not already installed in your environment):
   - Install via npm:
     ```bash
     npm install -D tailwindcss
     ```
   - Or use the CDN in your HTML file:
     ```html
     <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
     ```

## Usage

To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. It will display the site layout as per the cloned design.

### If using local Tailwind setup:

1. **Compile Tailwind CSS**:
   - Run the following command to generate the `tailwind.css` file:
     ```bash
     npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
     ```

2. **Open the HTML file**:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

### JavaScript

If you have added custom JavaScript to the project, ensure that it is properly linked in the HTML file, usually like this:

```html
<script src="./assets/js/script.js"></script>
```
